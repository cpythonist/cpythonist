I am Thiruvalluvan Kamaraj, aka @cpythonist.<br>
<br>
I'm fairly skilled in Python and have been using it since 2020. I'm currenly learning C for some high-performance applications.<br>
Please contact me via email if you want to collaborate. I'm open to projects in Python right now.<br>
<br>
I'm a self-taught programmer, so you may not see some of the qualities of actual trained software engineers.<br>
<br>
I'm employed at Infinite Inc. Infinite Inc. is a software company that primarily focuses on command-line applications.<br>
I'm the CEO, CTO, HR manager and whatever positions you can imagine of the company. That's because I'm the only person in this imaginary company. I hope one day it'll become a real company.<br>
<br>
In case you are interested, you can also take a look at [my website](http://cpythonist.github.io/) (it's a work-in-progress right now, sorry.)
